# 🌌 VibeCoding

A cosmic productivity suite for focused work and progress tracking.
Fuelled by experiment, distraction and Claude 🎃✨ (EDC)

## ✨ What's Inside

Two silly apps to keep Asia entertained while she wants to cry about XSTAR (gamification + creative visualisation + some charming software dev):

### ⚔️ Quest Log
A TODO tracker with RPG mechanics:
- Task management with categories and priorities
- Built-in focus timer with growing tree visualization
- XP and leveling system
- Streak tracking
- Beautiful analytics with mirrored bar charts (yes, this took a whoooole lot of debugging)
- CSV export for data analysis

**LLMs trying to vibe-teach me:** React, Vite, localStorage

### 🌌 CodeBit: virtual AstroPet feeding on small accomplishments
A cosmic web pet that evolves based on your work:
- Pet evolution system (Hydrogen Atom → X-ray Binary + cool historical names!)
- Work logging across different skill categories
- GitHub integration with auto-XP for commits
- Paper reading tracker
- Weekly reports and analytics
- Starfield background with SVG pet animations [planned]

**LLM tag-teaming on:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (React version coming soon!)
